# Dipsi

Easyly project deployment to the cloud

### Synopsis 

It is a simple and easy-to-use project deployment management tool. You can use this tool to transfer projects between hosts like **git**, but it's not that complex.

### Motivation 
Recently we've been using git as a tool to deploy our projects to the cloud. But for our small project implementation use, it is too complicated, we want something easy. Then we looked at firebase and npm they are very easy to use but... they can't be used on a private host like git. It is from this reason that we developed a simple project which we named Dipsi. Flexible like git and easy like firebase

### Installing 
```bash
# using npm

npm install dipsi --global

# using yarn

yarn add dipsi --global
```
